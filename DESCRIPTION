Title: An R client for interacting with the White House's "We The People"
    petition API.
Description: Implements an R client for the We The People petitions API. The
    client supports loading petitions, signatures, and users. Additionally, the
    package includes petition and signature data samples. There are also
    several functions for analyzing and visualizing the data. Term frequency
    calculations and word clouds are supported using the tm and wordcloud
    package, respectively. Petition and issue summary plots are also
    implemented using the ggplot2 package. For additional information about the
    We The People project, see https://petitions.whitehouse.gov.
